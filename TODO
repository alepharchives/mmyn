* Make use of erlcfg
* add commands to mmyn script via nodetool:
    start/stop/status tx_nanny
    start/stop/status rx_nanny
    start/stop/status webservice
    add/remove/view sms alert list
    send an sms
    get statistics on webservice tps
    get statistics on rx tps

* Pull out all other constants into config file

* Log and track:
    webservice transactions 


* Support global configs for all tx/rx and per instance configuration
  overriding, this would allow, different one application to use say multiple
  smsc accounts for proper load-balancing, etc.

  Also, extend this to support virtual instances, which would basically be like
  the entire application with its own seperate configuration, running still
  inside one vm instance.

* Allow passing of smpp34 options in the config file, so we no more need
  to run a separate branch for badly behaved and toy SMSCs
* Allow passing in a configurable interval for smpp34 enquire_link intervals
