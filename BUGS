Whenever we make a gen_server:call, we have to properly respond if timeouts occur.
Basically, handle this condition so the VM stays up, but we reject the requests,
also make the timeouts to gen_server:call's configurable, so we can increase
the vm timeout window.

The following activities need to be made asynchronous:
    - Pushing into a queue
    - Calling an external URL
    - Writing to files/logs
